            <h1>What is the body mass index (BMI)?</h1>
            <p>
              The body mass index (BMI) is a measure that uses your height and
              weight to work out if your weight is healthy.
              <br />
              The BMI calculation divides an adult's weight in kilograms by
              their height in metres squared. For example, A BMI of 25 means
              25kg/m2.
            </p>
            <h2>BMI ranges</h2>
            <p>
              For most adults, an ideal BMI is in the 18.5 to 24.9 range. For
              children and young people aged 2 to 18, the BMI calculation takes
              into account age and gender as well as height and weight.
              <br />
              If your BMI is:
              <br />
              below 18.5 – you're in the underweight range<br />
              between 18.5 and 24.9 – you're in the healthy weight range<br />
              between 25 and 29.9 – you're in the overweight range<br />
              between 30 and 39.9 – you're in the obese range<br />

              calculator. <br />
            </p>
            <h2>Accuracy of BMI</h2>
            <p>
              BMI takes into account natural variations in body shape, giving a
              healthy weight range for a particular height.
              <br />
              As well as measuring your BMI, healthcare professionals may take
              other factors into account when assessing if you're a healthy
              weight.<br />
              Muscle is much denser than fat, so very muscular people, such as
              heavyweight boxers, weight trainers and athletes, may be a healthy
              weight even though their BMI is classed as obese.<br />
              Your ethnic group can also affect your risk of some health
              conditions. For example, adults of South Asian origin may have a
              higher risk of some health problems, such as diabetes, with a BMI
              of 23, which is usually considered healthy.<br />You should not
              use BMI as a measure if you're pregnant. Get advice from your
              midwife or GP if you're concerned about your weight.
